# Parallax Web Application

A modern, single-page web application for managing vehicles, user accounts, and blacklist queries — inspired by Apple-style UI aesthetics.
All data is stored locally in the browser (localStorage), and the entire app operates without any backend.

`index.html` contains all UI sections:

- Authentication container
- Register form
- Reset form
- Vehicles Management
- Account Management
- Query page

`app.js` dynamically shows/hides these sections depending on login state.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

No dependencies, no frameworks—just open the HTML file.

### Run Locally

#### Option 1:

Open index.html in any browser.

#### Option 2 (recommended for module-safe localStorage behavior):

npx serve then open the URL shown in the terminal

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Regions or Phone Codes

Edit the objects inside:

```
const REGION_OPTIONS = [ ... ];
```

### Adding Vehicle Makes and Models

Modify:

```
const VEHICLE_DATA = {
"Toyota": [ "Camry", "Corolla", ... ],
"Mercedes-Benz": [ "C-Class", ... ],
...
};
```
### Updating UI Theme

Edit color gradients, shadows, and card styles in styles.css.

## 🧪 Known Issues / TODOs

- No backend; authentication is client-side only
- No encryption of stored passwords (browser localStorage limitation)
- Manufacturer → model mapping can be extended further
- Future updates may include:
- i18n support
- Real API backend
- Dark mode
